## Goal

This project was created for personal use. The goal was to fetch
the first appointment from my [Morgen](https://www.morgen.so/) account
and use it to schedule my alarm for next morning in my Echo Dot Speaker.

## Status

- The integration with [Morgen](https://www.morgen.so/) is completed.
- Apparently it is not possible to use an api to schedule an alarm in
  a Echo Dot Speaker. Probably gonna pivot to a
  [Alexa Skill](https://developer.amazon.com/pt-BR/alexa/alexa-skills-kit)
  triggered by a routine.
